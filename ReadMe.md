# LearningPandas
These are some notebooks I created to learn pandas.


## Motivation
I used this to learn the [basics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS) of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/).

## Pre-requisite Tools
The following tools are needed to run this application:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install#jupyter-notebook)


## Instructions
To go through the notebooks locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository onto your machine.
2. Open your terminal, and navigate into the repository.
3. Enter the following command to start the local Jupyter server: `jupyter notebook`
